He wanted to be able to speak up in class and also excel in his studies when he finally moves abroad. \n\nI learnt how to speak German in Germany. I understand that it is harder if you are outside of the country and of course everyday life circumstances comes in between.\n\nI would like to bridge that gap for you. If you are already experienced with the German Language we will only speak German. If you are a fresher I am glad to switch in between. Whatever works best for you to become better in the Language.\n\nI enjoy conversing. Talking about your everyday life and why you are learning German because at the end of the day all this is necessary to describe your experiences to others speaking the language.",

For example, general math has courses like A.P and G.P( in series and sequences) but further math goes ahead to treat convergence problems.\n\nIn times past, I have taught students in both junior and senior secondary classes who have struggled with understanding mathematics and they have gone on to write their JSSCE, WAEC and/or NECO and have passed.\n\nMy style of teaching includes establishing foundation topics in math before going further to further math questions or problems.\n\nI encourage every student to read through his/her notes and the topic to be discussed before each class, come to class with writing materials and a calculator, turn off every distraction including phones and participate in class well as show respect for the class.\n\nA well lighted and airy space, table(s) and chair(s), and a whiteboard maker will help make the class comfortable and condusive for learning.",

          "description": "I am an experienced teacher of mathematics and have been grooming students to love/appreciate numbers, making them learn maths and other numeric skills passionately. I teach by first of all making students to understand that mathematics is the simplest subject because it deals with facts and has a pattern, which could be logic oriented, formula or our common day to day examples of numbers, items and countable transactions. With this, they are always relaxed and secondly I understand the problem areas in the subject so I know the exact weak areas children face and I hit it squarely by throwing questions in those areas, giving assignments and responding to that by a way of assessment.\n\nIn fact, NewHall Internaational School Chevron, Lekki, where I teach, organizes after class periods for some average pupils, my participation in that class has been having a positive multiplier effect as my pupils/students record tremendous improvements which far outweighs past numeric abilities.\n\nFinally, I teach by connecting the known with what is not yet known to the students, this enables them to understand better any explanation. Also as a Montessori/IGCSE trained teacher I adopt numerous teaching methods that befits different learning categories. This has been giving me the desired results expected.",

          "description": "Dear Client,\n\nThank you for visiting my profile. Here are a few reasons why I'm the best available hand for your ward:\n\n1. General Mathematics teaches more than mere calculations, but equally, help students to develop analytical minds. If this is not gotten right at this level, a not so smart adult may result. Hence, it is important that an experienced and patient Tutor who will deploy an illustrative mode of teaching, to ensure that it is not only understood but enjoyed by the student. Having taught this for at least 3years at basic school level(primary and secondary), I believe I'm more than qualify to deliver.\n\n2. Not only have I taught for 3years, but I have also been able to achieve impressive results with my students. One of such is the Mosunmola who moved from hating Mathematics to loving it, and eventually had an A in Junior WAEC, after her parents had given up on her poor run of form in the subject.\n\n3. My relationship with my students goes beyond a pen and notepad. I do ensure that I become their friends, this makes me approachable, so they can easily inquire of me when they are having difficulty understanding what they are being taught. I deploy illustrative analogies to aid the learning process of my pupils and make the atmosphere less tense and friendly.",

I use modern teaching aids and techniques when tutoring my students, and also relate each concept to their daily experiences so they can understand and retain the knowledge better.\n\nI teach the major subjects for Years 1-6 such as English Language, Quantitatives, Mathematics, Creative & Letter Writing, Verbal Reasoning, ICT etc., as well as coach students in preparation for Common Entrance and secondary school exams, and have recorded great successes. In teaching young learners, I try to understand how best they learn and then tailor the lessons to suit them, while making emphasis on areas they may not have thoroughly understood.\n\nI am passionate about teaching. I strive to help my students master their numeracy, reasoning and vocabulary, including written and spoken English which are very important parts of training a pupil/student into a creative, analytical and responsible adult capable of self-sustained continuous learning. That's my joy as a teacher currently teaching at Lagoons.",

I use modern teaching aids and techniques when tutoring my students, and also relate each concept to their daily experiences so they can understand and retain the knowledge better.\n\nI teach the major subjects for Years 1-6 such as English Language, Quantitatives, Mathematics, Creative & Letter Writing, Verbal Reasoning, ICT etc., as well as coach students in preparation for Common Entrance and secondary school exams, and have recorded great successes. In teaching young learners, I try to understand how best they learn and then tailor the lessons to suit them, while making emphasis on areas they may not have thoroughly understood.\n\nI am passionate about teaching. I strive to help my students master their numeracy, reasoning and vocabulary, including written and spoken English which are very important parts of training a pupil/student into a creative, analytical and responsible adult capable of self-sustained continuous learning. That's my joy as a teacher currently teaching at Lagoons.",

          "description": "The only time I never had a distinction in Mathematics was during my first term in SSS1. That was because I joined the school during the 4th week, but then I still had the highest score. While in Primary school, I discovered a procedure for determining multiples of any number between 1 and 10, except 7 (which I had to read about years later). I was already reading Engineering Mathematics by K A Stroud while in JSS3.\nI taught an Ireland-based Nigerian girl who was preparing for SAT. Today, she's in the United States, having made her result excellently.\nI currently teach Further Mathematics, which is definitely an upgrade to General Mathematics. Interestingly, some of the topics in the Further Mathematics curriculum are being added to that of General Mathematics.\nWhen I teach, my goal is that my students understand what they are learning. If I have to teach a prerequisite topic, I do, because I really want them to know. Mathematics as a subject requires some level intuition. It's natural. Sometimes, I have to cite practical examples, if necessary, to pass the intended message.\nAll I require of my potential student is interest in and willingness to know Mathematics.",
